# Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
**Automate the running of the new code** (that has passed CI) **to the end user**
- **Delivery** is the automation of the entire process, but with a **manual approval right before Deployment** to end user
- **Deployment** is when the **entire process** is automated, **all the way to the end user**
